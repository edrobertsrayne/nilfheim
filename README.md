# üèîÔ∏è Nilfheim - NixOS/Darwin Configuration

A declarative, modular infrastructure-as-code configuration for personal homelab
and development workstations.

## Overview

Nilfheim is a NixOS flake-based configuration managing self-hosted services,
enterprise-grade infrastructure, and cross-platform development environments.
Built for reproducibility, security, and ease of management.

**What it provides:**

- **Self-hosted homelab services** - Media streaming, automation, monitoring,
  and utilities
- **Enterprise infrastructure** - ZFS storage, mesh networking, centralized
  logging, encrypted backups
- **Reproducible deployments** - Declarative configuration across Linux and
  macOS hosts
- **Developer-friendly workflow** - Automated validation, one-command deploys,
  modular design

**Target audience**: NixOS users building homelabs, learning declarative
infrastructure, or managing multi-host environments.

## Architecture

Nilfheim manages four hosts with specialized roles:

- **Thor** (homelab server) - Media services, monitoring stack, centralized
  storage, network infrastructure
- **Freya** (ThinkPad T480s laptop) - Workstation with GNOME/Hyprland, connects
  to Thor via NFS
- **Loki** (VPS) - Lightweight cloud deployment
- **Odin** (macOS) - Cross-platform development environment

**Design principles:**

- **Role-based composition** - Hosts select from predefined roles (common,
  server, workstation, vps)
- **Centralized constants** - Single source of truth for ports, paths, network
  settings (`lib/constants.nix`)
- **Service abstractions** - DRY configuration for similar services (e.g., *arr
  suite via `mkArrService`)
- **Modular organization** - Services by category, clear separation of
  platform-specific code

**Technologies**: NixOS, ZFS with impermanence, Tailscale mesh network, agenix
secrets management.

See [CLAUDE.md Architecture Overview](CLAUDE.md#architecture-overview) for
detailed system design.
