## Tips & Tricks

1. **Keyboard-First Philosophy**: Following omarchy's design, everything is accessible via keyboard
2. **Described Bindings**: All shortcuts include descriptions for the hint system â€” press `Super+/` (if configured) to see available shortcuts
3. **Consistent Patterns**:
   - `Super` for actions
   - `Super+Shift` to move windows
   - `Alt` for precise adjustments or alternative behaviors
4. **Window Grouping**: Use `Super+G` to create tabbed containers for better organization
5. **Workspace Shortcuts**: Direct access to 9 workspaces via number keys
6. **Custom Launchers**: `launch-terminal` and `launch-browser` scripts provide enhanced launching functionality
