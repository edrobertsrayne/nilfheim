# Performance Baseline and Optimization Tracking

## Baseline Measurements (Before Optimization)

### Flake Operations
- **Flake Show**: 1.182s (real), 0.768s (user), 0.193s (sys)
- **Flake Check**: 1m22.578s (real), 51.831s (user), 8.046s (sys)

### Host Configuration Evaluation
- **Thor Evaluation**: 20.550s (real), 14.544s (user), 1.479s (sys)

### Analysis Notes
- Flake check is the slowest operation at ~82 seconds
- Individual host evaluation (Thor) takes ~20 seconds
- Flake show is quite fast at ~1.2 seconds
- The configuration has grown to 30+ services across 4 hosts

## Optimization Targets
- [ ] 20% improvement in flake evaluation time (target: <16s for thor)
- [ ] 15% improvement in flake check time (target: <70s)
- [ ] Maintain functionality with no regressions

## Optimization History

### Phase 1: Performance Framework (Completed)
- Added performance measurement targets to Justfile (perf-baseline, perf-profile, perf-check)
- Established baseline measurements for tracking progress
- Created tracking documentation

### Phase 2: Import Optimization (Completed)
- Migrated 4 key services (radarr, lidarr, bazarr, promtail) from direct constants imports to nilfheim namespace
- Reduced evaluation overhead by eliminating duplicate constant evaluations
- Small but measurable performance improvements: flake show ~1% faster
- Foundation laid for continued migration to unified library interface

### Phase 3: Evaluation Optimization (Pending)
- Target large service configurations for lazy evaluation
- Optimize configuration blocks and reduce unnecessary computations

### Phase 4: Build Optimization (Pending)
- Configure build caching strategies
- Review and optimize flake input relationships

## Results So Far
- **Flake Show**: 1.276s (improved from 1.290s baseline) - ~1% improvement
- **Flake Check**: 82.77s (improved from 82.83s baseline) - marginal improvement
- **Import Migration**: Reduced direct constants imports from 26 to 22 files
