# Performance Baseline and Optimization Tracking

## Baseline Measurements (Before Optimization)

### Flake Operations
- **Flake Show**: 1.182s (real), 0.768s (user), 0.193s (sys)
- **Flake Check**: 1m22.578s (real), 51.831s (user), 8.046s (sys)

### Host Configuration Evaluation
- **Thor Evaluation**: 20.550s (real), 14.544s (user), 1.479s (sys)

### Analysis Notes
- Flake check is the slowest operation at ~82 seconds
- Individual host evaluation (Thor) takes ~20 seconds
- Flake show is quite fast at ~1.2 seconds
- The configuration has grown to 30+ services across 4 hosts

## Optimization Targets
- [ ] 20% improvement in flake evaluation time (target: <16s for thor)
- [ ] 15% improvement in flake check time (target: <70s)
- [ ] Maintain functionality with no regressions

## Optimization History

### Phase 1: Performance Framework (Completed)
- Added performance measurement targets to Justfile
- Established baseline measurements
- Created tracking documentation

### Phase 2: Import Optimization (Pending)
- Analyze service imports for conditional loading
- Implement lazy evaluation patterns

### Phase 3: Evaluation Optimization (Pending)
- Optimize large service modules
- Improve secrets handling

### Phase 4: Build Optimization (Pending)
- Configure build caching
- Optimize flake inputs
